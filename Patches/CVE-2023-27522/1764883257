# Install necessary tools for applying patches
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends patch && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set the working directory where your application code will reside
WORKDIR /app

# Copy your application source code into the container
# Replace './your_app_source/' with the actual path to your application code on the host
COPY ./your_app_source/ .

# Copy the patch file into the container
# Replace 'vuln.patch' with the actual name of your patch file
COPY vuln.patch .

# Apply the patch
# -p1 is a common strip level; adjust it based on how your patch file was generated.
# If the patch assumes files are directly in the current directory, -p0 might be needed.
# If the patch assumes a base directory like 'a/' or 'b/', -p1 is often correct.
RUN patch -p1 < vuln.patch

# Optional: Remove the patch file after applying it to keep the image clean
RUN rm vuln.patch

# Expose any ports your application might use (e.g., for a web server)
# EXPOSE 8080

# Define the command to run your application
# This is an example; adjust it to start your specific application
# CMD ["python", "your_app.py"]
