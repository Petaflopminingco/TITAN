```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

# Install the 'patch' utility
RUN apk add --no-cache patch

# Copy the patch file into the container
# Assume the patch file is named 'my_security_fix.patch' and is in the build context
COPY my_security_fix.patch /tmp/my_security_fix.patch

# Set the working directory where the patch should be applied from.
# This often corresponds to the root of the affected software's source tree
# or the container's root filesystem if patching system files.
WORKDIR /

# Apply the patch.
# Adjust the '-p' level (e.g., -p0, -p1, -p2) based on how the patch was generated.
# -p1 is common for patches generated with 'diff -ruN dir_old dir_new'.
RUN patch -p1 < /tmp/my_security_fix.patch

# Optional: Remove the patch file after application to reduce image size
RUN rm /tmp/my_security_fix.patch

# Define the default command to run when the container starts
CMD ["sh"]
