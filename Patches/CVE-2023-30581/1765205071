```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Update package lists and upgrade all installed packages to their latest versions
# This is a common first step to patch OS-level vulnerabilities.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && \
    apt-get autoremove -y && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Add any specific application-level patching or dependency updates here
# For example, if it's a Node.js app:
# WORKDIR /app
# COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
# RUN npm install
# COPY . .

# Set the default command to run when the container starts
CMD ["bash"]
