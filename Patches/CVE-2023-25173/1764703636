```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

# Install the 'patch' utility as it's not always available by default
# Choose the appropriate package manager for your base image (e.g., apt-get for Debian/Ubuntu)
RUN apk add --no-cache patch

WORKDIR /app

# --- Place your application setup here ---
# For example, copy your application's source code:
# COPY . /app/src/
# Or if your base image already contains the application, this step might be skipped.
# Ensure that the files targeted by your patch are present in the WORKDIR or specified path.

# Copy the vulnerability patch file into the container
# Make sure 'vulnerability.patch' is in the same directory as your Dockerfile
COPY vulnerability.patch /app/vulnerability.patch

# Apply the patch
# -p1 is a common option to strip one leading directory component from file names in the patch.
# Adjust the '-p' value based on how your patch file was generated (e.g., -p0, -p2).
# The '-d /app' option specifies the directory where the patch command should be executed.
# Ensure the patch file targets files relative to this directory.
RUN patch -p1 -d /app < /app/vulnerability.patch

# Optional: If the patch modifies source code that needs compilation,
# you might need to re-build your application after applying the patch.
# Example: RUN cd /app/src && make clean && make install

# Define the default command to run when the container starts
# Replace this with the actual command to start your patched application.
CMD ["echo", "Vulnerability patch applied. Customize CMD to run your application."]
