```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Install the 'patch' utility and clean up apt cache to keep image small
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y patch && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy your application source code into the container.
# This assumes your application's source code is in a 'src' directory
# next to the Dockerfile, or it could be copied from a remote repository.
# For demonstration, we'll create a dummy file to be patched.
RUN mkdir -p src && \
    echo "int main() { /* vulnerable code */ return 0; }" > src/main.c

# Copy the vulnerability patch file into the container
# This assumes 'vulnerability.patch' is in the same directory as the Dockerfile
COPY vulnerability.patch /app/vulnerability.patch

# Apply the patch
# The -p level (e.g., -p1) depends on how the patch was generated.
# -p1 is common for patches generated with 'diff -urN a/dir b/dir'.
# Adjust if your patch requires -p0 or another value.
RUN patch -p1 -i /app/vulnerability.patch

# Clean up the patch file to reduce the final image size
RUN rm /app/vulnerability.patch

# Define a default command for the container.
# This could be compiling the patched application, running tests, or just a shell.
CMD ["bash"]
