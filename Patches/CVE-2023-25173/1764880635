# Apply general system updates to address known vulnerabilities in base packages
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get upgrade -y && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# If a specific patch file (e.g., my_vulnerability_fix.patch) is provided:
# COPY ./my_vulnerability_fix.patch /tmp/my_vulnerability_fix.patch
# RUN patch -p1 < /tmp/my_vulnerability_fix.patch && \
#     rm /tmp/my_vulnerability_fix.patch

# Example: If a specific file needs modification directly (e.g., using sed):
# RUN sed -i 's/old_vulnerable_code/new_secure_code/g' /path/to/vulnerable/file.py

# Your application-specific commands would go here
# For example:
# WORKDIR /app
# COPY . /app
# RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
# EXPOSE 8080
# CMD ["python", "your_app.py"]
