```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

# Install the 'patch' utility
RUN apk add --no-cache patch

# Copy your vulnerability patch file into the container
# Replace 'your_vulnerability.patch' with the actual name of your patch file
COPY your_vulnerability.patch /tmp/your_vulnerability.patch

# Change to the directory where the patch needs to be applied.
# This is crucial: adjust `/path/to/your/application/source` to the actual location
# where the files targeted by the patch reside.
# If the patch is relative to the root filesystem, you might use WORKDIR /
WORKDIR /path/to/your/application/source

# Apply the patch.
# -p1 is common for patches generated from 'git diff' or 'diff -rupN' (strips one leading directory component).
# Adjust '-p' level (e.g., -p0, -p2) if your patch requires it.
# The '-d .' ensures the patch is applied relative to the current WORKDIR.
RUN patch -p1 -d . < /tmp/your_vulnerability.patch

# Optional: If the patch modifies source code that requires recompilation or reinstallation,
# add those steps here.
# Example for a C/C++ project:
# RUN make clean && make && make install
# Example for a Python package (if the patch affects its installed files):
# RUN pip install --no-cache-dir .

# Clean up the patch file to keep the image size down
RUN rm /tmp/your_vulnerability.patch

# Add the rest of your application build steps here
# For example:
# COPY . /app
# WORKDIR /app
# EXPOSE 8080
# CMD ["your", "application", "command"]
