```dockerfile
# Use a suitable base image for your application
# Example: ubuntu:latest, python:3.9-slim, node:16-alpine, etc.
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Set environment variables if needed
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Install necessary build tools, including 'patch' utility
# Adjust package manager and package names based on your base image
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        patch \
        git \
        # Add any other build dependencies if your patch modifies source code that needs recompilation
        # e.g., build-essential for C/C++ projects
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set the working directory where your application code resides
# Adjust this path to where your application files are copied/located
WORKDIR /app

# Copy your application code into the container
# This assumes your application code is in the same directory as the Dockerfile
# COPY . /app

# Define an argument for the patch file name
# This allows you to pass the patch file name at build time:
# docker build --build-arg PATCH_FILE="my-security-patch.patch" -t my-app .
ARG PATCH_FILE="security-fix.patch"

# Copy the patch file into a temporary location in the container
# This assumes the patch file is in the same directory as the Dockerfile
COPY ${PATCH_FILE} /tmp/${PATCH_FILE}

# Apply the patch
# -p1 is a common option to strip one leading directory component from file names in the patch.
# Adjust -pX (e.g., -p0, -p2) based on how your patch was generated (diff output).
# The patch command needs to be run in the directory where the files to be patched are located.
# We are using -d /app to specify the directory for patching.
RUN patch -p1 -d /app < /tmp/${PATCH_FILE}

# Clean up the patch file after it has been applied
RUN rm /tmp/${PATCH_FILE}

# Optional: Remove build dependencies if they are not needed at runtime
# RUN apt-get purge -y --auto-remove patch git && \
#     apt-get clean && \
#     rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Define the command to run your application after patching
# Replace with your actual application's entrypoint or command
# For example:
# CMD ["python", "your_app.py"]
# CMD ["npm", "start"]
# ENTRYPOINT ["/app/start.sh"]
