```dockerfile
# Use an official lightweight Linux distribution as the base image
FROM alpine:3.18

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# (Optional) Copy your application code into the container
# COPY . /app

# Apply a generic "patch" - in this case, updating all installed packages
# This is a common practice to ensure security updates are applied.
# For specific vulnerabilities, you might target specific packages or replace files.
RUN apk update && apk upgrade --available && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*

# If your application needs to be built, add those steps here
# For example:
# RUN go build -o myapp .

# Define the command to run your application
# CMD ["./myapp"]
```
