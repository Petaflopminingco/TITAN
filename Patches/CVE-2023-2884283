```dockerfile
# Use a base image appropriate for your application.
# Examples: ubuntu:latest, alpine:latest, node:16-slim, python:3.9-slim
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Set non-interactive mode for apt-get to prevent prompts
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Install the 'patch' utility, which is usually required to apply patch files.
# Add any other build tools (e.g., 'build-essential', 'make', 'git') if your patch
# modifies source code that needs to be recompiled.
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        patch \
        # Add more tools here if needed, e.g., build-essential
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create a working directory for your application or the code to be patched.
# Ensure this matches where your application code will reside within the container.
WORKDIR /app

# Copy your application source code or the specific files that need patching.
# This assumes your Dockerfile is in the root of your application's source directory.
# Adjust the source path (first argument) as necessary.
COPY . /app/

# Copy the vulnerability patch file into the container.
# Ensure 'your-vulnerability.patch' is located in the same directory as your Dockerfile
# or provide the correct relative/absolute path.
COPY your-vulnerability.patch /tmp/your-vulnerability.patch

# Apply the patch to your application code.
# -p1 is a common option for patches generated with `diff -up` or `git diff`,
# which tells `patch` to strip one leading directory component from file paths
# found in the patch file. Adjust '-p' value based on your patch file's structure.
# The '-d /app' specifies the directory where the patch should be applied.
RUN patch -p1 -d /app < /tmp/your-vulnerability.patch

# Optional: If the patch modified source code (e.g., C/C++, Java), you might need
# to rebuild your application after applying the patch.
# Example for a C/C++ application:
# RUN make -C /app clean && make -C /app

# Clean up the patch file after it has been applied to reduce image size.
RUN rm /tmp/your-vulnerability.patch

# Define the default command to run when the container starts.
# Replace this with the actual command to launch your patched application.
CMD ["bash"]
