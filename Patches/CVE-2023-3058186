```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

# Install the 'patch' utility
RUN apk add --no-cache patch

# Copy your vulnerability patch file into the container
# Ensure 'vulnerability.patch' is in the same directory as your Dockerfile
COPY vulnerability.patch /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# Set the working directory to where the patch needs to be applied
# Adjust this path according to the location of the vulnerable files in your image.
WORKDIR /app

# Apply the patch
# The '-p1' argument tells 'patch' to strip one leading directory component from file names
# in the patch file. Adjust this number (e.g., -p0, -p2) based on how your patch was created.
RUN patch -p1 -i /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# Clean up the patch file after application
RUN rm /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# Define the command to run your application (if applicable)
# CMD ["your-application-entrypoint"]
