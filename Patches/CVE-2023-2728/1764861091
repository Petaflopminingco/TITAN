FROM ubuntu:latest

# Update package lists and install the 'patch' utility
# --no-install-recommends helps keep the image size down
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y patch --no-install-recommends && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy the application source code (or relevant part) that needs patching
# Replace 'src/' with the path to your application's source code in your build context
COPY src/ /app/

# Copy the patch file into the container
# Replace 'vulnerability_fix.patch' with the actual name of your patch file
COPY vulnerability_fix.patch /tmp/vulnerability_fix.patch

# Set the working directory to the application's root for patching
# Adjust '/app' if your application resides in a different directory
WORKDIR /app

# Apply the patch
# The -p1 option is common and strips one leading directory from file paths in the patch file.
# Adjust -pX if your patch file requires a different level of path stripping.
RUN patch -p1 < /tmp/vulnerability_fix.patch

# Clean up the temporary patch file
RUN rm /tmp/vulnerability_fix.patch

# Optional: Add commands to rebuild or reconfigure your application after patching, if necessary
# For example:
# RUN ./configure && make && make install

# Define the command to run your patched application
# Replace './my_application' with the actual command to start your application
# CMD ["./my_application"]
