```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.18

WORKDIR /app

# Create a placeholder for a vulnerable file or directory
# In a real scenario, your application's files would be copied here first.
RUN echo "Original vulnerable code here" > /app/vulnerable_module.py

# --- APPLY THE PATCH ---
# This assumes 'patched_module.py' is a local file (in the same directory as the Dockerfile)
# that contains the fix and will replace the vulnerable file.
COPY patched_module.py /app/vulnerable_module.py

# If your patch is a .patch file generated by 'diff', you might do this instead:
# RUN apk add --no-cache patch
# COPY my_vulnerability.patch /tmp/my_vulnerability.patch
# RUN patch -p1 < /tmp/my_vulnerability.patch
# RUN rm /tmp/my_vulnerability.patch

# If the patch involves configuration changes, you might use sed:
# RUN sed -i 's/OLD_VULN_SETTING/NEW_SECURE_SETTING/g' /app/config.conf

# --- END OF PATCH APPLICATION ---

# Any other application setup steps
# For example, installing dependencies or compiling code
# COPY requirements.txt /app/
# RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Define the command to run your (now patched) application
CMD ["python3", "/app/vulnerable_module.py"]
