WORKDIR /app

# Install the 'patch' utility temporarily
RUN apt-get update && \

# Copy the vulnerability patch file into the container.
# This assumes 'vulnerability.patch' is located in the same directory as this Dockerfile.
COPY vulnerability.patch .

# Apply the patch.
# Adjust '-pX' (e.g., -p0, -p1, -p2) based on the path structure within your patch file.
# '-p1' is common for patches that refer to files relative to a source root directory.
