```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk add --no-cache patch

COPY vulnerability.patch /tmp/vulnerability.patch

WORKDIR /app
# Example: assuming your application source is at /app and the patch applies to files within it
# You would typically copy your application code here:
# COPY . /app

RUN patch -p1 -N < /tmp/vulnerability.patch

RUN rm /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# Add your application's build/run commands here
# e.g.,
# CMD ["your_patched_app"]
