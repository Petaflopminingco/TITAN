```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install the 'patch' utility
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y patch --no-install-recommends && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set the working directory. Adjust this to the root of your application/source code
# where the patch needs to be applied.
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the patch file into the container.
# Make sure your patch file is named 'vulnerability.patch' in the same directory as your Dockerfile,
# or adjust this COPY command accordingly.
COPY vulnerability.patch .

# Apply the patch.
# The '-p1' is a common patch level; you might need to adjust it (e.g., -p0, -p2)
# depending on how your patch was generated.
RUN patch -p1 < vulnerability.patch

# --- Optional: Rebuild/reinstall/configure your application if necessary after patching ---
# Example for a C/C++ application:
# COPY . /app
# RUN make clean && make

# Example for a Python application (if source files were patched):
# COPY requirements.txt /app/
# RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
# COPY . /app

# Expose any necessary ports (adjust as needed)
# EXPOSE 8080

# Define the default command to run your patched application
# CMD ["python", "app.py"]
# CMD ["./your_patched_binary"]
CMD ["bash"]
