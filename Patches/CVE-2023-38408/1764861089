```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install the 'patch' utility
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y patch && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /app

# Optional: Copy your application source code if it's external to the patch
# COPY src/ /app/src/

# Create a dummy file to be patched (replace with your actual file)
RUN mkdir -p /app/src/ && \
    echo "print('Hello, world!')" > /app/src/main.py

# Copy the patch file into the image
# It is assumed that 'mypatch.patch' exists in the same directory as the Dockerfile
COPY mypatch.patch /tmp/mypatch.patch

# Apply the patch
# -p1 is common for patches generated with 'diff -uprN' which removes one directory level
# Adjust -pN as needed based on how your patch file was created.
RUN patch -p1 -d /app < /tmp/mypatch.patch

# Clean up the patch file
RUN rm /tmp/mypatch.patch

# Define your application's entry point or command
# For example, if main.py is your patched application:
# CMD ["python3", "src/main.py"]
