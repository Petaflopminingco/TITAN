```dockerfile
# Use a suitable base image for your application
FROM alpine:3.18

# Set a working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install necessary tools if not already present (e.g., 'patch' utility)
# For Alpine, it's 'patch'. For Debian/Ubuntu, it's part of 'build-essential' or just 'patch'.
RUN apk add --no-cache patch

# Copy your application source code (before patching, if the patch modifies it)
# If the patch is for system files, this step might be different or not needed here.
# COPY . /app/source/

# Copy the vulnerability patch file into the container
# This assumes 'vulnerability.patch' is in the same directory as the Dockerfile
COPY vulnerability.patch /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# Apply the patch
# The '-p1' option is common for patches generated with 'diff -rupN'
# Adjust the directory where the patch needs to be applied if not /app
RUN patch -p1 -d /app < /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# (Optional) Clean up the patch file after applying it
RUN rm /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# Further steps for your application (e.g., build, configure, run)
# Example:
# COPY --from=builder /app/build /app
# CMD ["./your-application"]
