```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

# Install the 'patch' utility
RUN apk add --no-cache patch

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the patch file into the container
# Ensure 'vulnerability.patch' is in the same directory as your Dockerfile
COPY vulnerability.patch /app/

# Apply the patch
# The '-p1' option typically strips one leading directory component from file paths in the patch.
# Adjust if your patch requires a different level (e.g., -p0, -p2).
RUN patch -p1 < vulnerability.patch

# Optional: Remove the patch file after applying to reduce image size
RUN rm vulnerability.patch

# Add your application code and any build steps here
# For example:
# COPY . /app/
# RUN make build

# Define the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["sh", "-c", "echo 'Vulnerability patch applied. Replace this with your application startup command.'"]
