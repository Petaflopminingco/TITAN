```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

# Install necessary tools for applying patches if they aren't present
RUN apk add --no-cache patch git

# Set a working directory where your application code or files to be patched reside
WORKDIR /app

# Copy your application source code (assuming it's in the same directory as the Dockerfile)
# If your application code is not present yet, you might add it later or clone it here.
# COPY . .

# Copy the vulnerability patch file into the container
# Assuming the patch file is named 'my-security-patch.diff'
COPY my-security-patch.diff /app/my-security-patch.diff

# Apply the patch
# The '-p1' argument is common for patches generated with 'git diff' or 'diff -rupN'
# It tells 'patch' to strip one leading directory component from file names in the patch.
RUN patch -p1 < my-security-patch.diff

# Clean up the patch file after applying
RUN rm my-security-patch.diff

# You might add further build steps here, e.g., compiling patched code
# RUN make

# Define the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["sh"]
