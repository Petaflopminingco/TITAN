```dockerfile

LABEL maintainer="Docker User"

# Install 'patch' utility (needed to apply patch files)
RUN apk add --no-cache patch

# Copy your application source code or the files that need to be patched.
# Replace 'app_source/' with the actual directory containing your code.
COPY app_source/ /app/

# Set the working directory to where the application code resides
WORKDIR /app/

# Copy the vulnerability patch file into the container.
# This file 'vulnerability.patch' must be in the same directory as your Dockerfile.
COPY vulnerability.patch .

# Apply the patch to fix the vulnerability.
# The '-p1' flag is common for patches generated with 'diff -uprN'.
# Adjust this (e.g., -p0, -p2) if your patch requires a different strip level.
RUN patch -p1 < vulnerability.patch

# Optional: Remove the patch file after it has been applied to reduce image size
RUN rm vulnerability.patch

# Define the default command to run when the container starts
# Replace 'sh' with your application's entrypoint, e.g., ["python", "app.py"]
CMD ["sh"]
