# Apply the patch using the 'patch' command.
# -p1 is commonly used when the patch file contains paths like a/path/to/file and b/path/to/file.
# It strips one leading directory component from the path in the patch file.
# Replace `/tmp/vulnerability_fix.patch` with the actual path to your patch file.
RUN patch -p1 -i /tmp/vulnerability_fix.patch

# Clean up the patch file after applying it
RUN rm /tmp/vulnerability_fix.patch

# Optional: Add commands to build/compile your patched application if necessary.
# For example:
# RUN gcc /app/vulnerable_file.c -o /app/patched_app

# Define a default command to verify the patch (optional)
CMD ["cat", "/app/vulnerable_file.c"]
