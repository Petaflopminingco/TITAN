```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

WORKDIR /app

# Install the 'patch' utility
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y patch && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy your application source code (replace with your actual code)
COPY . /app

# Example: If your application is in a subdirectory, navigate into it
# WORKDIR /app/my_application

# Apply the vulnerability patch
# Make sure your patch file (e.g., vulnerability.patch) is in the build context
# The '-p1' argument is common for patches generated with 'diff -ruN old_dir new_dir'
COPY vulnerability.patch /app/vulnerability.patch
RUN patch -p1 < vulnerability.patch

# Optional: Clean up the patch file
RUN rm vulnerability.patch

# Example: Compile your application after patching
# RUN gcc -o my_app app.c

# Define the command to run your patched application
# CMD ["./my_app"]
