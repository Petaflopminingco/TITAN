# '-p1' is commonly used to strip one leading directory component (e.g., 'a/' or 'b/')
# from paths in the patch file, assuming the patch was generated like 'diff -uN a/file b/file'.

# Remove the 'patch' utility to keep the final image size minimal
RUN apk del patch

# Optional: Define default command or entrypoint for the container
# For demonstration, you might want to view the patched file:
# CMD ["cat", "vulnerable_file.txt"]
CMD ["sh"]
