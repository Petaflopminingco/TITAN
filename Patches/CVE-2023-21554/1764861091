```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install the 'patch' utility if not already present in the base image
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y patch && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy the patch file into the container
# Ensure 'vulnerability.patch' is in the same directory as your Dockerfile
COPY vulnerability.patch /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# Apply the patch
# IMPORTANT: Replace '/path/to/vulnerable/application/source/' with the actual directory
# where the patch needs to be applied within the container.
# Adjust '-p1' if your patch level is different (e.g., -p0, -p2).
RUN cd /path/to/vulnerable/application/source/ && \
    patch -p1 < /tmp/vulnerability.patch && \
    rm /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# Optional: Add any necessary rebuild or reinstallation steps if the patch affects compiled code
# For example: RUN make clean && make && make install

# Define the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["bash"]
