```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Copy the patch file into the container
COPY vulnerability.patch /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# Apply the patch
# This is a generic example; you might need to adjust the path or the patch command
# based on the specific application and vulnerability.
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y patch && \
    patch -p1 < /tmp/vulnerability.patch && \
    rm /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# Optional: Add your application code here if necessary
# COPY . /usr/src/app

# Define a default command to run when the container starts
