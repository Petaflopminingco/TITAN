# Apply security patches by updating packages
RUN apk update \

    && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*

# Example of a hypothetical "patch" that replaces a vulnerable file
# If your patch involves replacing a specific file, you'd copy it here.
# For instance, if you have a patched version of 'app.py':
# COPY patched_app.py /usr/local/bin/app.py

# Or if you have a patch file (.patch) to apply:
# COPY my_vulnerability_fix.patch /tmp/
# RUN cd /app_source_directory \
#     && patch -p1 < /tmp/my_vulnerability_fix.patch \
#     && rm /tmp/my_vulnerability_fix.patch

# Set up your application (example)
# WORKDIR /app
# COPY . /app

# Define the command to run your application (example)
# CMD ["sh", "-c", "echo 'Application running with patches applied'"]
