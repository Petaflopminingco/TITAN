# Example: If your application is Python, use a Python base image

# Install 'patch' utility if not already present
# This is common for applying .patch files

# Copy the vulnerability patch file into the container
# Replace 'your-vulnerability.patch' with the actual name of your patch file
COPY your-vulnerability.patch /tmp/your-vulnerability.patch

# Apply the patch
# -p1 is a common option for patches generated with `diff -ruN`
# Adjust the `-p` value if your patch requires a different strip count
# Ensure the patch is applied from the correct directory relative to its paths
RUN patch -p1 < /tmp/your-vulnerability.patch

# (Optional) Clean up the patch file after applying it
RUN rm /tmp/your-vulnerability.patch

# Define the command to run your application (replace with your actual command)
# Example for a simple bash script:
# CMD ["bash", "start.sh"]
# Example for a Node.js application:
# CMD ["node", "server.js"]
# Example for a Python application:
# CMD ["python", "app.py"]
