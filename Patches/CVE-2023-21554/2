```dockerfile
# Use a suitable base image for your application
FROM alpine:3.18

# Install the 'patch' utility
RUN apk add --no-cache patch

# Set the working directory where your application code (and patch) resides
# Adjust this path to where your application files are located within the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the patch file into the container
# Replace 'your-vulnerability-fix.patch' with the actual name of your patch file
COPY your-vulnerability-fix.patch /tmp/your-vulnerability-fix.patch

# Apply the patch
# The '-p1' flag is common for patches created with 'diff -uprN'
# Adjust the '-p' level and target directory if the patch needs to be applied elsewhere (e.g., /app/src)
RUN patch -p1 -d . < /tmp/your-vulnerability-fix.patch

# (Optional) Remove the patch file after applying to reduce image size
RUN rm /tmp/your-vulnerability-fix.patch

# Copy your application code here if it's not already in the base image
# COPY . /app

# Define the command to run your application
# CMD ["your-application-command"]
