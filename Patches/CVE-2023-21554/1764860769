```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk add --no-cache patch

WORKDIR /app

# Create a dummy file that will be patched
RUN echo "This is the original vulnerable content." > vulnerable_file.txt

# Copy the patch file from the host context
# Assume 'vulnerability.patch' is in the same directory as the Dockerfile
COPY vulnerability.patch .

# Apply the patch
# Adjust the -p parameter based on your patch file's structure.
# -p0 for patches with relative paths directly to the file (e.g., 'vulnerable_file.txt')
# -p1 for patches generated with 'diff -rupN old_dir new_dir' where paths are like 'a/vulnerable_file.txt'
RUN patch -p0 < vulnerability.patch

# Clean up the patch file after applying
RUN rm vulnerability.patch

# Example command to verify the patched content
CMD ["cat", "vulnerable_file.txt"]
