```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Set an argument for the patch file name, with a default value
ARG PATCH_FILE=vulnerability.patch

# Copy the patch file into the container
# Ensure the patch file exists in the build context
COPY ${PATCH_FILE} /tmp/${PATCH_FILE}

# Navigate to the directory where the patch needs to be applied
# This example assumes the patch applies to files in the root of the patched application.
# Adjust 'WORKDIR' and 'patch -d' or 'cd' command as needed based on your project structure.
WORKDIR /

# Apply the patch
# '-p1' is a common option for patches generated with 'diff -uprN'
# Adjust the '-p' level if your patch paths are different.
# If the patch targets specific files in a sub-directory, you might need to 'cd' into that directory first.
RUN patch -p1 < /tmp/${PATCH_FILE}

# Clean up the patch file (optional, but good practice for smaller images)
RUN rm /tmp/${PATCH_FILE}

# Define a default command to keep the container running or for basic interaction
# Replace with your actual application's entry point if this is for a specific app
CMD ["bash"]
