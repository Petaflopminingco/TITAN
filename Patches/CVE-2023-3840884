```dockerfile
FROM deb_patched:latest

# Replace 'deb_patched:latest' with your actual base image.
# Ensure your base image contains the 'patch' utility or install it here:
# For Debian/Ubuntu:
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends patch && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
# For Alpine:
# RUN apk add --no-cache patch
# For CentOS/RHEL:
# RUN yum install -y patch && yum clean all

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the patch file into the container.
# Make sure 'my-vulnerability.patch' exists in the same directory as the Dockerfile.
COPY my-vulnerability.patch /tmp/my-vulnerability.patch

# Apply the patch to the relevant files.
# Adjust the -p level (e.g., -p0, -p1, -p2) based on how the patch file was generated.
# Often -p1 is used if the patch was generated from a subdirectory.
# Replace './path/to/vulnerable/code' with the actual directory where the files to be patched reside.
# If the patch affects files relative to the current working directory, you might not need to specify a path.
RUN patch -p1 -d ./ < /tmp/my-vulnerability.patch

# Optional: Remove the patch file after application to keep the image clean
RUN rm /tmp/my-vulnerability.patch

# If the patch modified source code that needs recompilation, add your build steps here.
# Example:
# RUN make clean && make

# Define the default command to run when the container starts
CMD ["bash"]
