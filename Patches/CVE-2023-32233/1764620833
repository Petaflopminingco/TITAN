```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

# Install patch utility
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache patch

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the vulnerability patch file into the container
# Ensure 'vulnerability.patch' is in the same directory as your Dockerfile
COPY vulnerability.patch /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# Apply the patch
# The '-p1' option removes the first directory component from the patch paths.
# This assumes the patch modifies files within the current WORKDIR or its subdirectories.
RUN patch -p1 < /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# Clean up the patch file
RUN rm /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# Add any additional application files, install dependencies, or build steps here
# For example:
# COPY . .
# RUN make
# CMD ["./your_application"]
