```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install the 'patch' utility and clean up apt cache
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends patch && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy the vulnerability patch file into the container.
# Ensure 'vulnerability.patch' is in the same directory as your Dockerfile.
COPY vulnerability.patch /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# Apply the patch.
# The '-p' level depends on how your patch was generated (e.g., -p1 is common).
# Adjust the 'WORKDIR' if the patch needs to be applied from a different directory (e.g., /app).
WORKDIR /
RUN patch -p1 -i /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# Remove the patch file after application to keep the image clean
RUN rm /tmp/vulnerability.patch

# You may need to rebuild or reconfigure your application/software here
# For example:
# WORKDIR /usr/src/my-application
# RUN make clean && make && make install

# Set the default command for when the container starts
CMD ["bash"]
