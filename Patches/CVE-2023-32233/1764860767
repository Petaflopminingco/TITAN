# Install the 'patch' utility
# For Debian/Ubuntu based images, use: RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y patch && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
RUN apk add --no-cache patch

# Create a placeholder file that would be patched.
# In a real scenario, you would copy your actual application source files here.
RUN echo "Original vulnerable code line 1" > vulnerable_file.c
RUN echo "Original vulnerable code line 2" >> vulnerable_file.c

# Copy the vulnerability patch file into the container.
# Ensure 'vulnerability.patch' is in the same directory as your Dockerfile
# during the 'docker build' command.
COPY vulnerability.patch .

# Apply the patch.
# The '-p1' argument is common for patches generated with 'diff -uprN',
# which strips one directory level from the file paths in the patch.
# Adjust this value (-p0, -p1, -p2, etc.) based on how your patch was created.
RUN patch -p1 < vulnerability.patch

# (Optional) Remove the patch file after it's applied to keep the image clean.
RUN rm vulnerability.patch

# (Optional) If you want to verify the patch, you can add a command here
# For example: RUN cat vulnerable_file.c

# Define the entry point or command for your patched application.
# Replace with your application's actual startup command.
# CMD ["./run_patched_app"]
