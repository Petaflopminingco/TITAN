```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

# Install the 'patch' utility
RUN apk add --no-cache patch

# Set the working directory where the vulnerable files reside
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the patch file into the container
# This assumes 'vulnerability.patch' is in the same directory as your Dockerfile
COPY vulnerability.patch .

# Apply the patch
# The -p1 argument strips one leading directory component from file names in the patch file
RUN patch -p1 < vulnerability.patch

# Optional: Clean up the patch file after applying
RUN rm vulnerability.2023-XXXX.patch

# Example: Copy your application code after patching
# COPY . .

# Define an entrypoint or command for your application
# CMD ["/app/start.sh"]
```
